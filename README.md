# Sloe Gin

A theme for Tumblr, styled with SCSS.

## To compile

Because Tumblr themes are one-page HTML documents, this project's stylesheet compiles from SCSS to CSS which is then minified and injected into `main.html`. To compile, simply run `npm run style` or `gulp inject-compiled`.

## Acknowledgements

Amongst other things, this project wouldn't be possible without [gulp-inject](https://github.com/klei/gulp-inject).
